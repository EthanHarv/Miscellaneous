# im a kid ok

let me make minecraft stuff

also i need to relearn all of java, i haven't used it since around 2014 so im going to be horrible for awhile.

## ok so here's the actual project

im going to make a plugin for a local minecraft server im hosting to create a simple gamemode called 'rush,' based on speedrunning using bridging techniques. gonna be figuring this out as I go along, really. Definately not a main project, just something fun to do on the side with some friends.
